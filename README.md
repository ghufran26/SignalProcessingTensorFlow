# Deep Learning architecture for signal processing with multiple classes TensorFlow 2.0 implementation

The purpose of this repository is to provide widely used state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for signal processing. The following are the deep learning architectures:

1. Multi Layer fully connected Deep Neural Network file name DNN.py
2. One dimensional Convolutional neural network file name oneDcnn.py
3. Long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) file name lstm.py
4. One dimensional CNN with LSTM-RNN ( 1DCNN-LSTM-RNN) file name convcnn.py
